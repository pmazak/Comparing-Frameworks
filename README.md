You'll want the particular Scala IDE eclipse that goes with Scala 2.10.x.
[Scala-IDE](http://scala-ide.org/download/current.html)

**For Play:** cd play-scala-app; play run;     
http://localhost:9000/  &  http://localhost:9000/tasks

**For Scala-Spring:** cd scala-spring-app; gradlew war jettyRun;      
http://localhost:8080/ & http://localhost:8080/api/task/list
(supposedly gradle doesn't need to be installed with this wrapper)
